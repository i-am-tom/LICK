# LICK

LICK is a correct-by-construction implementation of the simply-typed lamba
calculus' expressions, beta-reduction, and evaluation. It was built during
my [Habito](https://habito.com) lunch hours with that dude who writes all
the PureScript, [Liam](https://github.com/liamgoodacre).

LICK introduces a few motivating examples for GADTs and dependent types. I'll
be writing a few blog posts about it. Watch this space.
